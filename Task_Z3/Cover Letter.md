Dear Hiring Manager,

I am Jia Ying, an undergraduate from the National University of Singapore, majoring in Computer Science. I am writing to express my interest in the Software Engineer position in SoC QuickTalk.

With a few internship stints in frontend web development, I have experience contributing to production software in fast-moving industries such as cryptocurrencies and e-commerce. During my previous role as a Software Engineering Intern in Shopee, I worked on internal services used by operations teams in Shopee and was exposed to the software development lifecycle in there.

Besides my internships, I am someone who does my best to improve the team culture of any software development team I am a part of. I do my best to contribute ideas and take ownership of the product I am building.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to speaking with you about this opportunity.

Best Regards,

Chow Jia Ying
